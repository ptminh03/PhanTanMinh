# Problem 4: Three ways to sum to n
Provide 3 unique implementations of the following function in TypeScript.
- Comment on the complexity or efficiency of each function.

**Input**: `n` - any integer
*Assuming this input will always produce a result lesser than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`*.

**Output**: `return` - summation to `n`, i.e. `sum_to_n(5) === 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 === 15`.

**Advance** This feature does not yet describe the case `n < 1`, so assume that:
- returns -1 for n < 0
- return 0 for n = 0
